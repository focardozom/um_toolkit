# Toolkit

Underage alcohol use and misuse (e.g., binge drinking)  is a significant health problem in communities. Studies have shown that the risk of an alcohol dependence disorder is 5 times greater for those youth who began drinking before age 15  as those who waited until age 21 or later to begin drinking. This Toolkit provides a guide to adapting and implementing an evidence-informed and community-driven approach to preventing youth alcohol use and misuse. This approach, derived from the evidence-based Communities That Care prevention system is called Businesses That Care (BTC). 

As the name suggest, BTC develops a network of local businesses that are dedicated to improving the health and well-being of youth in the areas that those businesses serve. Employees of these businesses form a multi-company “Prevention Committee” that serves as a driver for assessing local needs and implementing prevention programs and strategies that meet those needs.

In the Zacatecas City Pilot, two adapted interventions: Tomando Buenas Decisiones (Spanish-language and Mexican-adapted version of the Guiding Good Choices program) and AHORA (Aprendiendo dar Habilidades Oportunidades, y Reconocimiento a Adolescentes; Spanish-language and Mexican-adapted version of the Social Development Strategy) were implemented as part of the BTC system there.   This toolkit provides a step-by-step approach to the process of adapting and implementing these interventions in your community. Reference materials for BTC Zacatecas initiative can be found in the Appendix.

# Purpose of the Toolkit

This toolkit is intended to help communities develop and implement a comprehensive approach to preventing youth alcohol use and misuse through mobilizing the local private sector (businesses) for effective action.

# It will help you 

Identify local businesses to be part of BTC in your community.
Develop a local BTC Prevention Committee, assess salient risk and protective factors, and create an action plan for sustained implementation of tailored preventive interventions.
Communicate effectively within BTC companies and with the broader community. 
Monitor and maintain the fidelity of the BTC system and the prevention programs that are implemented as part of the system.

# Who is this toolkit for?

Small- to medium-sized communities where building a broader community prevention coalition may not be feasible or difficult to implement. These communities should have a network of 4 to 8 businesses that have a commitment to social responsibility and are dedicated to the health and well-being of their community’s youth population. Companies should have a commitment from their workers to participate in this effort. It should be noted that this is an employer initiative with the larger community following this lead.
