### Background

In 2015, the AB InBev Foundation [(ABIF)](https://abinbevfoundation.org/) launched the [“Global Smart Drinking Goals”](https://www.ab-inbev.com/smart-drinking/smart-drinking-goals/) to reduce by 10% the harms associated with AU in six cities around the world, including Zacatecas, Mexico.

The [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) was contacted by ABIF to reduce the existent high prevalence of underage drinking in Zacatecas      (53.2% lifetime alcohol use & 14.5% binge drinking between ages 12 to 17 years) (Villatoro-Velázquez et al., 2017).

After an initial needs assessment of the context, the University of Miami partnered with a local private businesses to develop Businesses That Care (BTC) [(Dr. Eric C. Brown, Principal Investigator)](https://people.miami.edu/profile/ecb41@miami.edu).

The network has committed to support the adaptation and implementation of preventive interventions (EBPIs) under a high-fidelity approach (Montero-Zamora et al., 2021).

### In Mexico:
[Armendáriz García et al. (2014)](https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3704/370441817010.pdf) found that family history of alcohol use predicted alcohol use in university students. [Strunin et al. (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460313001718?casa_token=r0x46WHxsisAAAAA:6FbuiYDcEeWsxPQPIcVsV9Z5O7i7pHaG8aRCHiMjVLvsqHr1IGp2OvZUbC1oUomrGHr1G13sLQ) found that Mexican adolescents aged 14–16 who reported lower perceived parental monitoring were more likely to be frequent drinkers and begin using alcohol at an earlier age. 

Effect of TBD on reducing general family risk levels for youth alcohol use has a major public health application revealing the potential of adapted parent competency training programs to mitigate harmful alcohol use in Mexico.
