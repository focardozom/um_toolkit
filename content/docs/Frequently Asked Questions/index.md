## Why focus on private companies instead of the entire community like Communities That Care does?

In some communities that don’t have a lot of resources or capacity, it might be easier to start in just one sector of the community (i.e., the private sector) than in all sectors.

There are also some survey instruments that can be helpful in assessing community readiness (see hyperlink on this page). Finally, talking with experts and technical assistance providers will go a long way toward determining if the BTC system is right for your community. The AB InBev Foundation can assist with this.
